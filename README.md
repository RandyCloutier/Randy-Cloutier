## ✨ About Me

I’m the founder of [Lux Lens RI](https://www.luxlensri.com) — where creative vision meets aerial precision. With over 20 years of experience behind the lens and in front of the mic, I combine drone cinematography, still photography, and audio storytelling to help people see and hear their world in unforgettable ways.

Whether it’s elevating a real estate listing, capturing once-in-a-lifetime events, or producing intimate podcast conversations, my mission is the same: **to tell stories that move people**.
